On that basis, the tax credit granted to the resident parent company under such national legislation is intended to prevent economic double taxation of profits distributed by a resident subsidiary which have already been taxed in the latter’s hands.

Consequently, the Member State in which the parent company is resident is required to accord fiscal treatment which is designed to achieve the same result as the tax credit granted by the Member State in which the subsidiary is resident to parent companies established there, with the effect that economic double taxation of profits distributed in the form of dividends is also avoided.	In a Member State in which the parent company is resident, the Member State in which the subsidiary is resident is required to give fiscal treatment which is designed to achieve the same result as the tax credit granted by the Member State in which the subsidiary is resident to parent companies established there, with the effect that economic double taxation of profits distributed in the form of dividends is also avoided.	0.14403603971004486	1

Thus, just as the resident parent company of a resident subsidiary is granted a tax credit by its Member State of residence, acting also in its capacity as the Member State in which the subsidiary is resident, the non-resident parent company of a resident subsidiary is protected against the risk of economic double taxation of profits distributed in the form of dividends, but by the Member State in which it is resident.

43 In that regard, it must be recalled that the second subparagraph of Article 4(5) of the Sixth Directive is intended to ensure compliance with the principle of fiscal neutrality (Case C‑430/04 Feuerbestattungsverein Halle [2006] ECR I‑4999, paragraph 24).	43 The second subparagraph of Article 4(5) of the Sixth Directive is intended to ensure compliance with the principle of fiscal neutrality (Case C430/04 Feuerbestattungsverein Halle [2006] ECR I4999, paragraph 24).	0.3714464604854584	1
44 Whilst it is true that the Sixth Directive provides for certain derogations which may interfere to some extent with the application of the principle of fiscal neutrality, like the derogation under the second subparagraph of Article 4(5) of the Sixth Directive (see, to that effect, Case C‑378/02 Waterschap Zeeuws Vlaanderen [2005] ECR I‑4685, paragraph 43), since that provision permits the treatment of bodies governed by public law as non-taxable persons provided that such treatment would only distort competition insignificantly, the fact remains that that derogation must be interpreted in such a way that the least possible damage is done to that principle.	44 During the procedure of drafting the Sixth Directive on fiscal neutrality, the provision of Article 4(5) is valid for any body governed by public law provided that such treatment would only distort competition insignificantly. However, in view of the particular provision of Article 4(5), it is necessary that the same be interpreted in such a way as the least possible damage is done to the principle.	-0.22586104273796082	1
