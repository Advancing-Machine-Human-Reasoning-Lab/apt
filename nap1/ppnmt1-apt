297 However, contrary to what the applicant claims, in essence, the Commission is not required to explain the need for each measure provided for by the restructuring plan or to seek to impose only the least restrictive measures possible among those likely to ensure the attainment of the objectives referred to in the preceding paragraph, unless either the Member State concerned has previously committed itself to a less restrictive restructuring plan, fulfilling those objectives in an equally appropriate manner, or that Member State has shown its opposition to the inclusion of certain measures in the restructuring plan and committed itself to that plan because the Commission had definitively informed it that the aid would not be authorised in the absence of those measures, since in those situations the decision to make the granting of the aid subject to compliance with those measures cannot be attributed to the Member State.

Nevertheless, it is for the national court to determine whether that is indeed the case, in particular where an applicant presents serious evidence to the contrary, and to determine, in cases in which national provisions permit the transfer of pension rights into another national scheme or into the scheme of an international organisation, whether the calculation of the sum to be transferred into the European Union pension scheme is not performed in a way unfavourable in relation to the calculation of the sum to be transferred into such other schemes.	In cases in which national provisions permit the transfer of pension rights into another national scheme or into the scheme of an international organisation, it is for the national court to determine whether that is indeed the case, in particular where an applicant presents serious evidence to the contrary, and to determine, in case in which national provisions permit the transfer of pension rights into other national schemes or into the scheme of an international organisation, whether the calculation of the sum to be transferred into the European Union pension scheme is not performed in a way unfavourable in relation to the calculation of the sum	0.25489678978919983	1

What is the reasoning behind question 2 on the subject of Article 11(2) of Annex VIII to the Staff Regulations and Article 4(3) TEU?
